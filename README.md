## 🔧 How to Maintain

### Adding New Wallets
1. **Update the Data:** Add new wallet entries to the `walletData` array in `app.js`. Follow the existing structure:
   ```javascript
   {
     "name": "Wallet Name",
     "platforms": ["iOS", "Android", "Chrome"],
     "custodyModel": "Self-custody",
     "dexSwap": true,
     "nftGallery": true,
     "staking": true,
     "fiatOnramp": true,
     "fiatOfframp": "Limited",
     "pushNotifications": true,
     "solanaPayQR": "Yes",
     "hardwareSupport": "Yes (Ledger)",
     "openSource": "Partial",
     "versionTested": "v1.0.0",
     "dateTested": "2024-01-01",
     "monthlyUsers": "1M+",
     "securityAudit": "Yes (Auditor Name)"
   }
   ```
2. **Test the UI:** Open `index.html` and verify the new wallet appears correctly in the grid and filters.
3. **Update Stats:** The statistics (total wallets, Solana Pay compatible, etc.) update automatically based on the data.

### Updating Existing Wallets
1. **Find the Wallet:** Locate the wallet entry in the `walletData` array in `app.js`.
2. **Update Fields:** Modify the relevant fields (version, date tested, features, etc.).
3. **Verify Changes:** Test the updates in the browser to ensure they display correctly.

### Adding New Features
1. **Data Structure:** Add new properties to the wallet objects in `walletData`.
2. **UI Updates:** Modify the HTML templates in `app.js` to display the new feature.
3. **Filtering:** Add filter options in `index.html` and update the filter logic in `app.js`.

### Regular Maintenance Tasks
- **Monthly Reviews:** Check for new wallet releases and feature updates
- **Security Audits:** Update audit status as new reports become available
- **User Counts:** Refresh monthly user statistics
- **Version Testing:** Update tested versions and dates
- **Solana Pay Support:** Verify QR code compatibility changes based on the [Solana Pay specification](https://github.com/solana-labs/solana-pay)
